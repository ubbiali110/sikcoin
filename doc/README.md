Sikcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Sikcoin Core is the original Sikcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Sikcoin transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download Sikcoin Core, visit [Sikcoincore.org](https://Sikcoincore.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Sikcoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/Sikcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/Sikcoind` (headless)
- `bin/Sikcoin` (wrapper command)

The `Sikcoin` command supports subcommands like `Sikcoin gui`, `Sikcoin node`, and `Sikcoin rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `Sikcoin help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run Sikcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Sikcoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Sikcoin Core.
